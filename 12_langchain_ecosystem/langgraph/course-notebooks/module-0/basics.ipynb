        "## Context\n",
        "\n",
        "At LangChain, we aim to make it easy to build LLM applications. One type of LLM application you can build is an agent. There’s a lot of excitement around building agents because they can automate a wide range of tasks that were previously impossible.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice though, it is incredibly difficult to build systems that reliably execute on these tasks. As we’ve worked with our users to put agents into production, we’ve learned that more control is often necessary. You might need an agent to always call a specific tool first or use different prompts based on its state.\n",
        "\n",
        "To tackle this problem, we’ve built [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) — a framework for building agent and multi-agent applications. Separate from the LangChain package, LangGraph’s core design philosophy is to help developers add better precision and control into agent workflows, suitable for the complexity of real-world systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Course Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "The course is structured as a set of modules, with each module focused on a particular theme related to LangGraph. You will see a folder for each module, which contains a series of notebooks. A video will accompany each notebook to help walk through the concepts, but the notebooks are also stand-alone, meaning that they contain explanations and can be viewed independent of the videos. Each module folder also contains a `studio` folder, which contains a set of graphs that can be loaded into [LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio), our IDE for building LangGraph applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you begin, please follow the instructions in the `README` to create an environment and install dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Chat models\n",
        "\n",
        "In this course, we'll be using [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#chat-models), which do a few things take a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs. LangChain does not host any Chat Models, rather we rely on third party integrations. [Here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/chat/) is a list of 3rd party chat model integrations within LangChain! By default, the course with use [GEMINI_API_KEY](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key/) because it is both popular and performant. As noted, please ensure that you have an `GEMINI_API_KEY`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's check that your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set and, if not, you will be asked to enter it."

Official Documentation:** The best place to start is the official LangChain documentation.  It\\'s well-structured and provides comprehensive tutorials and examples.  Look for their \"Getting Started\" guides and work your way through the examples.\\n\\n**2. Tutorials and Blog Posts:** Many tutorials and blog posts are available online covering various aspects of LangChain. Search for \"LangChain tutorial\" or \"LangChain example\" on Google, YouTube, and Medium.  Look for tutorials that focus on specific use cases that interest you, such as building a chatbot or a question-answering system.\\n\\n**3. GitHub Repository:** Explore the LangChain GitHub repository.  You can find the source code, contribute to the project, and see how different components are implemented.  This is helpful for understanding the inner workings of LangChain.\\n\\n**4. Courses and Workshops:** While not as prevalent as for some other technologies, you might find online courses or workshops specifically on LangChain or related topics like LLM application development.  Check platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and edX.\\n\\n**5. Hands-on Projects:** The most effective way to learn LangChain is by building projects. Start with small, manageable projects and gradually increase the complexity.  Try building a simple chatbot, a document question-answering system, or a summarization tool.  This will solidify your understanding and allow you to apply what you\\'ve learned.\\n\\n**Learning Path Suggestion:**\\n\\n1. **Start with the official documentation\\'s \"Getting Started\" guide.** This will give you a foundational understanding of the core concepts and components.\\n2. **Work through a few simple tutorials.** This will help you understand how to use LangChain in practice.\\n3. **Choose a project that interests you.** This will keep you motivated and help you apply your knowledge.\\n4. **Refer to the documentation and online resources as needed.** Don\\'t be afraid to ask questions on forums or communities dedicated to LangChain.\\n\\n\\nRemember to have a basic understanding of Python programming before diving into LangChain.

This will be the first U.S. presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census.[24][25] If the results of the 2020 election were to stay the same (which has never occurred in the history of presidential elections) in 2024, Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans\\' 235, a slight change from Biden\\'s 306 electoral votes and Trump\\'s 232, meaning that Democrats lost a net of 3 electoral votes to the reapportionment process.'}]"
